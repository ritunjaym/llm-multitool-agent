The study surveyed over 1,000 adolescents and found that those who spent more time on social media platforms reported higher levels of anxiety, depression, and feelings of loneliness.\n\nThe researchers believe that the constant comparison to others on social media, as well as the pressure to present a curated and idealized version of oneself online, can contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem in teenagers. Additionally, the study found that excessive social media use can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to decreased physical activity, further exacerbating mental health issues.\n\nThe findings of this study highlight the importance of monitoring and regulating teenagers' social media use, as well as promoting healthy offline activities and face-to-face interactions. Parents, educators, and mental health professionals are encouraged to be aware of the potential negative effects of social media on teenagers' mental well-being and to provide support and resources to help them navigate the digital world in a healthy and balanced way."

Use asyncio library: The asyncio library is the standard library for writing asynchronous code in Python. It provides a set of high-level APIs for working with asynchronous tasks, such as creating and running coroutines, managing event loops, and handling exceptions.\n\n3. Use async with and async for: The async with and async for statements allow you to work with asynchronous context managers and iterators, respectively. These statements make it easier to work with asynchronous resources and iterate over asynchronous sequences.\n\n4. Use asyncio.gather() for parallel execution: The asyncio.gather() function allows you to run multiple asynchronous tasks in parallel and wait for all of them to complete. This can help improve the performance of your asynchronous code by running multiple tasks concurrently.\n\n5. Use asyncio.run() for running asynchronous code: The asyncio.run() function was introduced in Python 3.7 and provides a simple way to run asynchronous code in a synchronous context. It creates a new event loop, runs the specified coroutine, and then closes the event loop.\n\n6. Use async generators: Async generators allow you to define asynchronous iterators that yield values asynchronously. This can be useful for working with asynchronous data streams or generating asynchronous sequences of values.\n\n7. Use asyncio.Queue for communication between tasks: The asyncio.Queue class provides a thread-safe way to communicate between asynchronous tasks. You can use it to pass messages or data between tasks in a producer-consumer pattern.\n\n8. Use asyncio.Lock for synchronization: The asyncio.Lock class provides a way to synchronize access to shared resources in asynchronous code. You can use it to prevent multiple tasks from accessing a shared resource simultaneously.\n\nBy following these best practices, you can write more efficient and maintainable asynchronous code in Python."
